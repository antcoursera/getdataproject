## Raw Data

Raw data was obtained from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip and documented in http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 

It represent data on 30 subjects collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone, while each person performed one of the six activities.

The dataset is randomly partitioned into two sets - test and train.

## Analysis 

`run_analysis.R` is the file that can be run as long as the Samsung data is in your working directory (unzipped, in folder named `UCI HAR Dataset`).

Output: `tidy_data.txt` file 

Please see `CodeBook.md` for details on processing.
